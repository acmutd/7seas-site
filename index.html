                        <p>HackUTD, the largest university hackathon in North Texas, is a weekend long event where students
                            build apps, hardware, and more. HackUTD provides a venue for self-expression and creativity
                            through technology. People with varying technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a
                            problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch. Whether you're a
                            frequent hackathon attendee or just getting started, weâ€™d love to see what you can make.</p>
